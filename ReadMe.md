#An Introduction to Digital Mapping

The following are materials used in our "Introduction to GIS" talk, when we deliver the talk, but without an hands-on component. You will find slides, as well as links to materials we reference in the talk.

**Earthworks.stanford.edu**  

[http://earthworks.stanford.edu](http://earthworks.stanford.edu)  
Earthworks is Stanford University Library's geospatial data discovery application. It provides search across the geospatial data holdings of eight major institutions with in browser preview of geometry and attributes. The application provides access to 23,000+ geospatial datasets, over 16,000 of which are in the public domain.

**Clowns of America, International Membership Point Shapefile (anonymized)**  

[https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/tf124yx1784](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/tf124yx1784)

This shapefile was created from the Clowns of America, International Membership Database (anonymized) obtained in 2007 from Clowns of America, International, for use in teaching. It was created by geocoding the ZipCode field of the original table, using OpenRefine and the Geonames.org PostalCodes API. Attributes include those from the original data table ('City', 'ZipCode', 'Clown_Name', and 'Country'), as well attributes added during the geocoding process ('admname1','adm1','adm2','placname','longitude','latitude') and an attribute 'Clown-Na_1' which represents the values in the 'Clown_Name' attribute field after a "Cluster and Edit" operation, performed in OpenRefine to collapse values so that "Co Co" or "Co-Co" both are clustered and edited to become "CoCo" for use in name frequency analysis.

**Photogrammar**  

[http://photogrammar.yale.edu/](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/)

Photogrammar is a web-based platform for organizing, searching, and visualizing the 170,000 photographs from 1935 to 1945 created by the United States Farm Security Administration and Office of War Information (FSA-OWI). The map plots the approximately 90,000 photographs that have geographical information. Customize your search by by photographer, date, and place.

**Radical Cartography**  

[http://www.radicalcartography.net/](http://www.radicalcartography.net/)
Bill Rankin is a historian and cartographer. His mapping activity is focused on reimagining everyday urban and territorial geographies as complex landscapes of statistics, law, and history. His maps have appeared in publications and exhibitions throughout the US and Europe, including articles in Perspecta, Harvard Design Magazine, and National Geographic and shows at Harvard University, Pratt Institute, the Cartographic Bienalle in Lausanne, the Triennalle di Milano, and the Toronto Images Festival; his maps also traveled for several years with ICI's "Experimental Geographies" exhibit. His historical research is about the politics of cartography and navigation in the twentieth century. He teaches at Yale University, where he is an assistant professor of the history of science. 

**The David Rumsey Map Collection**  

[http://www.davidrumsey.com/](http://www.davidrumsey.com/)  

The David Rumsey historical map collection has over 63,000 maps and images online. The collection includes rare 16th through 21st century maps of America, North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Pacific and the World.
Popular collection categories are celestial, antique atlas, globe, school geography, maritime chart, state, county, city, pocket, wall & case, children's, and manuscript maps. Search examples: Pictorial maps, United States maps, Geology maps, California map, Afghanistan map, America map, New York City map, Chicago map, and U.S. Civil War maps. Browse  map categories: What, Where, Who, When. The collection is used to study history, art, genealogy, explorations, and family history.

**Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States**

[http://dsl.richmond.edu/historicalatlas/](http://dsl.richmond.edu/historicalatlas/)

Here you will find one of the greatest historical atlases: Charles O. Paullin and John K. Wright's Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States, first published in 1932. This digital edition reproduces all of the atlas's nearly 700 maps. Many of these beautiful maps are enhanced here in ways impossible in print, animated to show change over time or made clickable to view the underlying data—remarkable maps produced eight decades ago with the functionality of the twenty-first century.
